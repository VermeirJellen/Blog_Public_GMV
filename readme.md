# Global Minimum Variance portfolio strategy in R
This project includes a backtest analysis of the Markowitz Global Minimum Variance (GMV) portfolio allocation strategy. We utilize a simple quadratic solver to perform the necessary optimizations and subsequently execute our backtests on historical data of two distinct portfolios:
<ul>
 	<li>the SPDR exchange traded funds.</li>
 	<li>14 of the BEL20 index stocks.</li>
</ul>
